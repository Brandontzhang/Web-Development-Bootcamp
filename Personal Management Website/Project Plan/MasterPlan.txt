Current Project Plan
Web development

Front End:
-html, css, and javascript
-css use bootstrap
-javascript for dynamic things?

Back End:
-javascript and mongodb for database
-not sure if this counts as part of the web development but apache or mamp for server?
    probably Apache since that seems to be most popular
